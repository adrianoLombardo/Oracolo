# Atoms UI Prototype

This folder contains a minimal prototype of the "Atoms" synthesizer UI built with
Python and QML using PySide6. The goal is to replicate the look of the Atoms
synth interface with custom controls such as circular knobs, arc sliders,
animated atom view and an XY pad.

## Running

```bash
python main.py
```

The application requires PySide6. The provided components are simple
implementations intended for demonstration and can be extended with additional
behaviour and styling.
